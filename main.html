		Three engineering students—Rancho, Farhan, and Raju—form a deep friendship at India's top college, Imperial College of Engineering, where Rancho's innovative and passionate approach to learning challenges the rigid, exam-focused system.
 The film explores themes of friendship, following one's passion, and the dangers of an unhealthy academic environment, highlighted by the suicide of a fellow student due to pressure.
 Ultimately, the story emphasizes that true education is about knowledge and personal growth, not just grades or certificates.
